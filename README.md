# Måtta (LEGACY)
This is the legacy version of [Matta](https://github.com/luqmanity/matta).
Måtta Legacy is no longer actively-developed, and is officially discontinued. Any bugs, problems
and issues related will have little to no chance of being fixed or repaired.
The new Måtta is a rewrite of this legacy repo, with cleaner code, improved simplicity and overall a 
much better experience.

The Måtta (LEGACY) Discord bot!

This bot is created for fun, with love and relentless effort and some uhh, late-night coding sessions lol.
Please note that this bot uses `cogs`, which is a way for pycord projects to have commands in different files
as extensions so the `main.py` wouldn't be a very long script (it used to be). It isn't too complicated to get
used to but I do recommend reading some materials on how it works before utilising this bot.

### Join the Nytra Discord server to see it deployed and get up to date:

### Other things worth your attention.
Note that a bot token is not included, please add one yourself by changing the TOKEN variable in the .env file.
You need to go to the developer developer portal, create a new application, and get your own bot token

To add your own bot token, simply add a `.env` file in the matta folder with the following content:
```env
TOKEN = "YOUR BOT TOKEN"
```
The bot will not run if the `.env` is missing from the main directory.

Commercial purposes is allowed, however, crediting is required.

`/help` - Outputs the interactive help menu message in server
